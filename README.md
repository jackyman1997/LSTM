# LSTM Autoencoder
This practise project attempts to use LSTM Autoencoder to mimic or forcast data. Data I used here is from my own work on [scraping HSI futures minute data](https://github.com/jackyman1997/aastock) from [AAstock](http://www.aastocks.com/tc/). 

# Notes

# Disclaimer
This practise project shall never be used for predicting any sort of finanical figures or data, and shall never trust the outcome generated from this project. Basically, this is a practise on how to convert time-series data into pytorch-ready tensors only, the LSTM model training is not the main idea.
